# Version 1.0.0
- 4 pipelines can be controlled by the main racoonFlyFish program.
        - Any number of RaCon polishing rounds (default = 4).
        - Any number of Flye polishing rounds (default = 4).
        - Any number of Medaka polishing rounds (default = 1).
        - The chimera pipeline for "duo" and "trio" polishing.
                - "duo" runs RaCon polishing followed by Flye polishing.
                - "trio" additionally runs Medaka polishing (only recommended for nanopore data).
                - At the moment, the pipeline runs the entire "trio" (TODO: allow stopping after "duo").
                - By default, only one round of each polisher is run.
                - At the moment, the ordering is always: all RaCon rounds, all Flye rounds, all Medaka rounds.
